    <h1>Welcome to my online resume</h1>



  <p class="bio-text">Originally from Cape Town, I moved to Kwa-Zulu Natal to persue a
    career in a multidiscliplinary role for an <a href="https://www.wkcgroup.com">environemtal consultancy firm</a>.
    Here I engaged in many discliplines such as web development, flow induced
    vibration, acoustic induced vibration, Hydrdynamic modelling and
    environmental permitting for a multitude of sectors including oil and gas in
    the middle east. The roles varied greatly and this is where I developed
    my interest in programming and web development, due to the variability in my
    responsibilities I quickly learned how to adapt and learn at an abnormal
    pace. This provided proof of concept that my strengths align with high
    pressure utility roles in the workplace</p>
